# React + Vite

Experiment with Claude Code to see how quickly it can reproduce an app from a photo of it. 

Total time : ~1 hr of work

Summary : It took Claude about 3 attempts to build out the app, there were some struggles with CSS conflicts and some potential improvments to the logic but it works well for a small app like this. I made various changes to help optimize but overall it could have been done after the first Claude iterations.
